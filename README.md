# stickies
A proof-of-concept user interface for a wall-mounted stickies board.

## Installing
To use run the project, you will need an android tablet running Android 5.0 Lollipop or more (API level 21). You can also use an emulator, but will most likely lose all multi-touch functionalities. Running the project on a device smaller than 10" will result in scaling problems and will severly reduce the usability of the app.\
You can build the project yourself, or simply download the apk provided in the "releases" section of the repository from your device, and install it. You will need to enable the "Allow App Installations from Unknown Sources" setting.
